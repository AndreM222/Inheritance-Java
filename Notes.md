Inheritance -> Is like creating a child from a class


------------Clear Terminal Code------------

ANSI escape code -> Is a sequence which can be interpeted as commands combined with bytes and characters

                 -> \033 means ESC or escape
                 -> combining \033 with [H moves the cursor to a specified position
                 -> 033[2J cleans the whole screen

                 -> Total: \033[H\033[2J

                 ->flush() flushes the content of the buffer to the output stream

Static -> In the Java programming language, the keyword static means that the particular member belongs to a type itself, rather than to 
          an instance of that type. This means we'll create only one instance of that static member that is shared across all instances of the class.

.equals() -> for comparing if equal string

Array And Array List -> A array can't add or remove. It is unchangable when set so in order to do that you need to use an array list or create a
                        new array with the old things but removed or add whatever I want.
